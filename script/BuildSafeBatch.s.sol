///         format — the shape you get from the UI's "export batch", and the shape
///         FraxFinance's `SafeTxHelper.writeTxs` writes:
///
///           { version, chainId, createdAt, meta, transactions: [ {to,value,data,operation} ] }

///         https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-standard-solidity/blob/master/src/SafeTxHelper.sol
///
///         Note what this format does *not* contain: no Safe address, no nonce, no
///         gas fields. A batch on its own is not yet a transaction — it becomes one
///         only once it is bound to a specific Safe at a specific nonce and folded
///         into a `multiSend` delegatecall. `forge-attest` does that binding from
///         its config, which is why the Safe address and nonce live there rather
///         than here.
///
///         `createdAt` is deliberately a wall-clock stamp, exactly as `SafeTxHelper`
///         writes it. That makes the raw bytes non-reproducible between runs — the
///         reason `forge-attest` pins a *canonical* digest (computed after folding
///         and normalisation) rather than only a byte-exact sha256 of this file.
